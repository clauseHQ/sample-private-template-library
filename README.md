# sample-private-template-library

This template library exists for you to use as a basis for your own template library.

You should fork (or download and copy) this repository to initialise your own.

Things to check when adding this library to Clause
1. Have you made a [release](https://github.com/clauseHQ/sample-private-template-library/releases) of your template library? You need to do this even when forking this repository. 
2. Does the folder name of your template match the package name in package.json?
3. Is your repository public? If not you will need to provide a [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to access from Clause.
4. Does the package.json file of your template contain a [cicero declaration](https://github.com/clauseHQ/sample-private-template-library/blob/master/my-contract/package.json#L8)?
